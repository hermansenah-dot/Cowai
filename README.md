Hello there.

Was inspired by Vedel, to try this AI thing out.
I know nothing about Python coding, so this is just to learn. Which has turned into a bit of an obsession to learn and understand.
Im not associated in anyway with anyone, and this is purely for my own entertainment. I just want to learn.

Most of it is vibe coded.

to-do:
-Reminder system rework
-trust system
-more optimised memory system
-more natural convosation flow
